# AI Usage Report

## Tools Used
- ChatGPT — for guidance, brainstorming, code reviews, and wording suggestions.

## What I Used It For
- Planning the project structure and required sections.
- Suggestions for CSS organization and responsive layout.
- Drafting small JS snippets which I read, understood, and edited.
- Copy editing for the About/Projects text to sound more professional.
- Creating a step-by-step plan to keep a meaningful commit history.

## How I Modified AI Outputs
- Rewrote and simplified code to match my style and course constraints.
- Tested in the browser, fixed bugs, and adjusted spacing/contrast.
- Replaced placeholders with my own project details (Reservation System, KFUPM Event Hub).

## Benefits & Risks
- **Benefits:** faster iteration, clearer structure, consistent styling.
- **Risks:** over-reliance or generic code — mitigated by manual review, edits, and testing; I take responsibility for all final code.

## Academic Integrity
- All final work was typed, verified, and adapted by me. AI assistance is acknowledged here for transparency.
