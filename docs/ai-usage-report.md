## ðŸ§  Assignment 1 Summary

In the first assignment, AI tools were mainly used for:
- Generating initial HTML/CSS layout templates.
- Validating responsive design and accessibility.
- Asking for explanations of CSS grid/flex patterns.
- Minor debugging with ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot.

**Learning Outcome:**  
Gained confidence in using AI to understand concepts rather than just copy code.

## ðŸš€ Assignment 2 Usage

This stage used AI more strategically for **planning and refinement**.

### Tools Used
- **ChatGPT (GPT-5)** â€“ planning feature ideas, generating snippets, accessibility advice.
- **GitHub Copilot** â€“ inline code suggestions in VS Code.
- **Replit Ghostwriter** â€“ quick syntax checks and code completion.

### Use Cases
1. **Planning:** asked AI to map Assignment 1 â†’ Assignment 2 requirements and propose new interactive ideas.  
2. **Code Generation:** used AI to scaffold filter/search logic, collapsible project details, and quote API fetch patterns.  
3. **Accessibility:** AI suggested ARIA attributes and reduced-motion best practices.  
4. **Documentation:** drafted this very report and the technical doc outline.

### Benefits
- Saved development time through faster prototype ideas.  
- Improved understanding of accessible web interactivity.  
- Encouraged modular, clean code structure.

### Challenges
- Needed to rewrite some AI-generated JS to fit existing DOM structure.  
- Balancing simplicity with feature richness.  
- Ensuring all AI-generated text followed academic integrity rules.

### Learning Outcomes
- Learned to **integrate AI responsibly** â€” using it for ideas and patterns, not direct copy-paste.  
- Improved skills in explaining and editing AI output.  
- Enhanced understanding of **fetch API**, **localStorage**, and **ARIA**.
